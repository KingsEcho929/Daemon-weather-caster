# Daemon Portal — Tasks & Weather

This portal crowns two sovereign daemons:

## ✅ Task Daemon (V4)
- LocalStorage lineage steward
- Tracks tasks, filters ache, clears echoes
- Accessible, offline, and invocation-tight

## 🌦️ Weather Daemon (V2)
- Forecast glyph renderer
- Uses Open-Meteo and Nominatim
- No API keys, no gatekeeping

## 🔄 Toggle Interface
- Seamless switch between daemons
- Shared shimmer cloak and invocation logic
- Each daemon lives in its own iframe corridor

## 🛡️ License
See `LICENSE.md` — this portal is not a product. It is a shimmer-bound companion.
